\begin{abstract}
The efficacy of drug treatments depends on how tightly small molecules bind
to their target proteins. Quantifying the strength of these interactions (the
so called ‘binding affinity’) is a grand challenge of computational
chemistry, surmounting which could revolutionize drug design and provide the
platform for patient specific medicine. Recently, evidence from blind
challenge predictions and retrospective validation studies has suggested that
molecular dynamics (MD) can now achieve useful predictive accuracy ($\leq$ 1
kcal/mol). This accuracy is sufficient to greatly accelerate hit to lead and
lead optimization.

To translate these advances in predictive accuracy so as to impact clinical
decision making requires that binding free energy results must be turned
around on reduced timescales without loss of accuracy. This demands advances
in algorithms, scalable software systems, and intelligent and efficient
utilization of supercomputing resources.

% Specifically, it necessitates refining algorithms and developing
% technologies to marshal huge simulation campaigns.

We introduce the use of a framework called HTBAC, designed to support the
aforementioned requirements of accurate and rapid drug binding affinity
calculations, to marshal huge simulation campaigns. HTBAC facilitates the
execution of the numbers of simulations while supporting the adaptive
execution of algorithms. Furthermore, HTBAC enables the selection of
simulation parameters during runtime which can, in principle, optimize the
use of computational resources whilst producing results within a target
uncertainty.
