\begin{abstract}
Recent improvements in computational power and algorithm design mean that
reliably quantifying ligand binding strength differences from molecular
simulation is becoming a genuine possibility. These developments have led to
increased interest in the use of molecular simulations for applications in both
computer-aided drug design and patient specific medicine. We have previously
demonstrated that simulation protocols based on ensembles of multiple runs of
the same system provide an efficient method for producing robust free energy
estimate, and equally important statistical uncertainties. Variations in the
chemical and biophysical properties of different systems impact the optimal
protocol choice for different proteins and classes of drugs targetting them.
This leads to the necessity of automation and middleware solutions that allow
adaptive execution of a wide range of simulation workflows. To support the
scalable, adaptive and automated calculation of the binding free energy on
high-performance computing resources, we introduce the High- throughput Binding
Affinity Calculator (HTBAC). HTBAC uses a building block approach in order to
attain both workflow flexibility and performance. We demonstrate close to
perfect weak scaling to hundreds of concurrent multi-stage binding affinity
calculation pipelines. This permits a rapid time-to-solution that is
essentially invariant of the calculation protocol, size of candidate ligands
and number of ensemble simulations. As such, HTBAC advances the state of the
art of binding affinity calculations and protocols.
