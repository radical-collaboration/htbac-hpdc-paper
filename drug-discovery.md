Binding free energy protocols like TIES, have the potential to replace parts of 
the current drug discovery pipeline in the pharmaceutical industry. Currently, 
execution of these protocols lacks the scale and turnaround time required for 
decision making in an industrial profit driven setting. For example, the lead 
optimization stage usually considers on the order of 10000 small molecules by 
calculating the binding affinity in vivo for a pharmaceutical campaign. 
While experiment automation reduces completion time, the in silico variant has 
the potential to cut time to completion and cost by an order of magnitude.

TIES requires approximately 25,000 CPU core hours for a single prediction. By 
extent, at least a quarter billion core-hours would be demanded for a large scale 
study that would support a pharmaceutical campaign, with a typical turnaround 
time of about 2 weeks. The adaptive component of HTBAC can reduce these 
high computational costs by a factor of 10. 

- Quality adaptivity: changing the error threshold for faster turnaround times.
(task attribute adaptivity) Error as a function of candidate number?

- Adaptive quadrature: decrease the core hours requirements per prediction due 
to adaptivity (task count adaptivity, task attribute adaptivity)

- Overview: what is our throughput, i.e. how many leads can we run?
